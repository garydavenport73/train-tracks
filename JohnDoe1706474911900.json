The search behavior behind the scenes looks for matches in the\nfollowing order:\n\n1) My Favorites Preference List: This is the list of orders that you can control. Orders you've starred (i.e.\nfavorited) are stored here.\n2) Browse and Preference List: This group of orders is included alongside your user preference list when you\ninitiate a search. This list is controlled by your project team. Ideally, Physician Builders at your site can also modify\nthese.\n3) Facility List: If you don't find a match in your initial search, consider clicking on the Facility List tab to see if there\nare other matches in your clinic formulary. Pharmacists and your Orders team are responsible for maintaining this\nlist.\n4) Database: This tab, although rarely available to clinicians, contains all of the orders that are available across the\nentire organization. If you need orders from the database list to be added to your facility or specialty preference\nlist, you should contact your Orders team.\n\nYou can see these preference lists when you click the preference list icon ‚ãÆ‚â° in the visit taskbar.\n\nYou can manually select the orders you need from these lists as well. In this session, you will learn some\nstrategies for organizing your user preference lists. We'll start by getting some orders added, and then we'll\nshowcase some of the things you can do to make finding those orders easier.\n\n1. Look up and select an order as you normally would. Then edit the order details and click CHECKMARK Accept (or just right-click in any blank space in the Order Composer!).\n2. Before signing your order, click ‚òÜ to add it to your preference list.\n  ‚óè The Add To Preference List window opens.\n3. In the Display name field, enter an easy-to-remember name for the order.\n ‚óè The next time you need to place this order, you can search for your saved order using any of the\nwords in this name, so include any search terms that will help you find the order later.\n ‚óè You can include a unique abbreviation that is shared by a group of related orders. For example, you\ncould end all of your STD labs with \"*std\" so that when you include \"*std\" in your search, all of\nthose labs are quickly found.\n4.

Leave the Pref List: field as Orders.\n ‚óè While you can save things on different lists, it does make maintenance somewhat more\ncomplicated, as you have to visit several lists to make updates.\n6. Configure any of the order details you want to include when you place this order in the future, such as\ninstructions, relative dates, diagnosis associations, or answers to questions, and click Accept.\n ‚óè Remember that these details appear only for you, and you can always update them later.\n"

On a given tab in Chart Review,\nyou can set up filters so that you can quickly summarize the information you are interested in. For example, when\nyou go to the Media tab you might want to only see images of a particular exam (colonoscopy or mammogram),\nor on the Encounters tab you might want to see visits with a particular reason for visit.\n\nWhen you open a tab in Chart Review, you will see some pre-set filters that appear as a series of check boxes next\nto the Filters button.\n\nIf you don't see a filter that meets your need, you can build your own Quick Filter and save it so it is one-click\naway the next time you need it.\n\n1. In Chart Review, go to the desired tab and click Filters.\n2. In the filter pane on the left, select the criteria and specific values you want to use for your filter.\n ‚óè If you don't see the value you want to include (because the current patient doesn't have that value in their chart), use the lookup field below the criteria list and your filter will include that search term.\n3. Select if you want this to be an inclusive or an exclusive criteria using the Include and Exclude buttons.\n‚óè The ability to use exclude filter criteria is available starting in the August 2020 version.\n4. At the bottom, click Save as New Filter.\n5. Enter a free-text name for your Quick Filter and click Accept.\n ‚óè The filter appears as a check box to the right of the pre-set filters.\n\nUpdate a filter you created\nYou can make updates to filters you previously created.\n\n1. In Chart Review go to the tab that has the filter you want to update.\n2. Click Filters.\n3. Select the filter you want to update.\n4. Change the filter for your needs.\n5. Click Save &lt;Name of the Filter&gt; to update the filter.\n ‚óè If you wanted to create an additional filter and keep the old filter, click Save as New Filter.\n\nDelete a filter you created\n1. In Chart Review, select the tab that has the filter you want to delete.\n2. Click üîß on the far right.\n3. Select Manage Quick Filters.\n ‚óè Manage Quick Filters window opens.\n4.
