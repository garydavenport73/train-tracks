The search behavior behind the scenes looks for matches in the following order:\n\n1) My Favorites Preference List: This is the list of orders that you can control. Orders you've starred (i.e.favorited) are stored here.\n2) Browse and Preference List: This group of orders is included alongside your user preference list when you initiate a search. This list is controlled by your project team. Ideally, Physician Builders at your site can also modify these.\n3) Facility List: If you don't find a match in your initial search, consider clicking on the Facility List tab to see if there are other matches in your clinic formulary. Pharmacists and your Orders team are responsible for maintaining this list.\n4) Database: This tab, although rarely available to clinicians, contains all of the orders that are available across the entire organization. If you need orders from the database list to be added to your facility or specialty preference list, you should contact your Orders team.\n\nYou can see these preference lists when you click the preference list icon ‚ãÆ‚â° in the visit taskbar.\n\nYou can manually select the orders you need from these lists as well. In this session, you will learn some strategies for organizing your user preference lists. We'll start by getting some orders added, and then we'll showcase some of the things you can do to make finding those orders easier.\n\n1. Look up and select an order as you normally would. Then edit the order details and click ‚úì Accept (or just right-click in any blank space in the Order Composer!).\n2. Before signing your order, click ‚òÜ to add it to your preference list.\n ‚óè The Add To Preference List window opens.\n3.

For example, you could end all of your STD labs with \"*std\" so that when you include \"*std\" in your search, all of those labs are quickly found.\n4. In the Section field, enter the name of the section in which you want this order to appear.\n ‚óè You may click New Section to create your own custom section.\n5. Leave the Pref List: field as Orders.\n ‚óè While you can save things on different lists, it does make maintenance somewhat more complicated, as you have to visit several lists to make updates.\n6. Configure any of the order details you want to include when you place this order in the future, such as instructions, relative dates, diagnosis associations, or answers to questions, and click Accept.\n ‚óè Remember that these details appear only for you, and you can always update them later."
